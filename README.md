# PageRank
Information Retrieval using Link-Based Methods such as PageRank and Topic Sensitive PageRank

In this project, I build a graph of documents using degree of similarity between two documents(I had these data) and then implemented PageRank algorithm to get a ranked list of documents.
For obtaining a ranked list related to a topic I implemented Topic Sensitive PageRank. Documents used for this project were standard persian documents that used for research called
Hamshahri.
